There is no official standard for Georgian braille. However a group of
very dedicated people from the Georgian Braille printing house and the
Georgian School For Blind maintain a de-facto standard.

## Origins and history of Georgian Braille

Georgian Braille was adopted in 1890s. In 1892 the first boarding-school
for blind was opened in Tbilisi. Georgian blind students and teachers
used Georgian Braille only in handwriting. The Braille printed books
were supplied from Russia since late 1960s. In 1967 a printing house
Skhivi was established in Tbilisi Georgia. The printing house was owned
by the Georgian Blind Union.

In 1990s, after the collapse of Soviet Union, the printing press stopped
working until 2005. The new generation Braille books were introduced to
blind users in 2005 and school textbooks are being printed since 2012.
There is still only one printing press in Georgia. The Braille printing
is fully based on the letters and symbols which were used in 1967-1992.

The Georgian Braille is standardized, due to the fact that there is only
one printing house and the persons who are employed there are skilled in
use of Braille. They are the teachers of the school for blind and
members of the Georgian Blind Union. There is only one magazine printed
in Braille in Georgia and that is also printed in the same printing
house. The national exams to enter the university are prepared by the
personnel employed at the Braille printing house
